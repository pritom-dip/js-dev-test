## Overview

This project is structured as a monorepo, allowing for better organization and management of multiple related projects within a single repository. It implements a Node.js scraper to fetch theatre shows data from an external API every 5 minutes and stores the data in a local file. Additionally, it creates a Node.js API endpoint to serve the scraped shows data from the local file. Furthermore, a React component consumes this API endpoint to display the shows data in a visually appealing grid layout. The monorepo structure facilitates code sharing, dependency management, and version control across the various components of the project, streamlining development and maintenance workflows. Overall, this project provides a comprehensive solution for fetching, storing, and presenting theatre shows data, leveraging the advantages of a monorepo approach for enhanced project management.
